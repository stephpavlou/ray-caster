This is a simple implementation of a ray-caster I wrote in Java in order to learn more about the technique in general and to offer some code to the internet should 
it help someone else in trying to write their own.

It is entirely contained within a single source file in order to make it easier to compile and it is written using the Swing toolkit for window creation and 
graphics.
